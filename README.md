# The Phonwork Project

This repository contains templates for generating a Phonetics Workbook as a static html site.  See the current version of the site at https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/phonwork

The aim is to create an open access phonetics workbook using a framework that makes it possible for phoneticians to make contributions to the workbook. Phonetics teachers around the world produce excellent phonetics exercises for their classes.  The hope of this project is to fascilitate the sharing of teaching materials, by making a broad and deep range of materials available in an open access format.

## The approach

Phonwork is a *framework* for producing and presenting phonetics exercises, and an *initial bank of exercises*.  The elements of the framework are relatively modular and extensible.  The **graphic user interface** is from the "Phantom" template by HTML5up.net, and can be replaced by other GUI frameworks.  The **javascript** functions to power the question/answer format of the exercises are in the file *exercises.js*. This is a pretty lean javascript framework that makes it possible to write new exercises without needing to write javascript. Many of the **initial bank of exercises** are drawn from the exercices for Ladefoged's "A Course in Phonetics" which is also hosted at UC Berkeley (https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/acip).  This project grew out of the experience of creating the Course in Phonetics site.  The **framework** of page templates and python scripts to generate the site allows for changes in contents and organization to be incorporated quickly and easily, and allows for the creation of local variants of the site. 

## Getting started

To get started with this repository, clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keithjohnson-berkeley/phonwork
```

The site is generated by a Python script with minimal dependencies. The
only required package that is not in the standard library is
[jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/). Install it before
trying to generate the site.

## Editing and building the site

Templates for the site pages are in the `_templates` directory. Templates
with filenames beginning with an alphabetic character are rendered as content
pages that use the overall layout determined by `_base_page.html`. Other
templates beginning with underscore may be used to include sublayouts and
are not rendered as separate html files.

To generate the site, do:

```bash
cd scripts
python generate.py
```

The content pages will be rendered to html files in the `_site` directory.
Before the pages are generated the existing `_site` directory will be
cleared of existing content.

## Viewing the site

Use your web browser to open the files in the `_site` directory to view
the current website.

## Publishing the site

If the results of viewing the site are satisfactory, push the changes to
github and then copy the current site files to the public server. A sample
set of commands:

```bash
# View repo status
get status

# Inspect, commit, and push changes
git diff _templates/mypage.html
git add templates/mypage.html
git commit -m 'Added a section to mypage.html'
git push

# Copy site files to public server
scp -R _site/* username@server.com:/sites/phonwork
```
